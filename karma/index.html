            </div>

            <p>My first experience relying on a WiFi hotspot was during my trip to <a href="/tokyo/">Tokyo</a> in 2015. I'd previously relied on Verizon and AT&amp;T's international travel plans, but they were prohibitively expensive, had uncomfortable data caps, and lived on confusing account pages. Renting an affordable LTE hotspot with unlimited data was liberating, letting me focus on my trip rather than rationing data and draining my phone's&nbsp;battery.</p>

            <p>Our country's lagging cellular infrastructure means we're years away from having similar products, but one company had been on my radar as a team subverting Verizon and AT&amp;T with easy-to-understand plans and well-designed hardware. In early 2016, I joined <a href="http://yourkarma.com">Karma</a> as their second product designer with the goal of making Internet access affordable and&nbsp;accessible.</p>

            <div class="mt-3 mb-3 mt-md-4 mb-md-4">
                <img class="display-block" src="/assets/images/karma/karma-go.jpg">

            </div>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Goodbye, Neverstop.</h2>

            <p>The day I arrived at Karma, we were in the process of discontinuing our monthly subscription service called Neverstop. Karma is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) &ndash; a type of data provider that doesn't own its network. Instead, we rely on data purchased wholesale from Sprint. We loved Neverstop's simplicity &ndash; $50 for unlimited Internet access &ndash; but customers' unexpectedly heavy data usage outweighed what we could afford. The plan was unsustainable.</p>

            <div class="mt-3 mb-3 mt-md-4 mb-md-4">
                <div class="b-1">
                    <img class="display-block" src="/assets/images/karma/the-verge.jpg">

            </div>

            <p>My job was to work on Neverstop's replacement &ndash; a capped, monthly subscription service we named Pulse. We were losing thousands of dollars each day Neverstop remained online, so it was important to work&nbsp;quickly.</p>

            <p>Unlike Neverstop's one-price-fits-all model, Pulse would have three tiers offering varying amounts of expiring monthly data. This meant our native apps and website required more than replacing the name and pricing. We would need to update nearly the entirety of our native apps and website, including our storefronts, account pages, and usage&nbsp;screens.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Since we were making adjustments throughout the app, <a href="https://twitter.com/alandickinson">Alan</a> and I took took the opportunity to clean up deisgn inconsistencies. <a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> became useful for sharing these changes with our engineers, giving them an easier way to calculate iOS and Android units on our new grid, reduce the number of type styles, and fix mislabeled&nbsp;colors.</p>

            </div>

            <p>We try to maintain feature parity between our apps and the web, so we designed a simplified web dashboard to more easily manage Pulse subscriptions. Our redesign consolidated the existing web dashboard from five pages to one, while still surfacing once-hidden usage&nbsp;details.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Revamping the Marketing Website</h2>

            <p>Even with the disappointment surrounding Neverstop, we were happy Pulse's launch. But our worry-free, unlimited data plan that had differentiated us was now as worry-inducing as capped plans from AT&amp;T, Verizon, and others. Our customer's excitement from Neverstop's launch in September had been replaced by frustration on social media, Karma Go returns and subscription&nbsp;cancellations.</p>

            <p>We believed we still had a great product, so we chose to update our website to better emphasize&nbsp;it.</p>

            <h3>Showcasing Karma Go</h3>

            <p>Compared to other hotspots wrapped in cheap plastic and carrier logos, Karma Go looked great next to a Macbook and a cup of coffee. Our customers loved sharing photos of theirs on Twitter and Instagram, and it was frequently featured in fashion-forward buyer&nbsp;guides.</p>

            <p>Despite how much attention we put into Karma Go's design, we never designed a product page to showcase it in&nbsp;detail.</p>

            <p>To show how Karma Go could fit into your lifestyle, I spent a few days photographing it alongside objects it might appear with &ndash; notebooks and MetroCards for people using Karma Go at work, and trail maps and passports for those on the&nbsp;go.</p>

            <h3>Leading With Sharing</h3>

            <p>Karma's other differentiator is its sharing model. Because of its open SSID, anyone can connect to a Karma Go and get online with their own data. The owner is rewarded with free data of their own, making them feel good about getting others online in the process. Every day, we would receive emails from excited customers who had earned hundreds of megabytes by leaving their Karma Go on at airports or&nbsp;festivals.</p>

            <div class="mt-3 mb-3 mt-md-4 mb-md-4">

            <p>Our homepage hadn't been updated in several months. Since its launch, Neverstop came and was replaced by Pulse &ndash; a different model than the strictly pay-as-you-go language we led&nbsp;with.</p>

            <p>We needed to show our two data options alongside clearer shots of Karma Go and more visible app download links. Most visibly though, we also decided to dedicate space to feeling good by&nbsp;sharing.</p>

            <h3>Explaining Our Plans</h3>

            <p>Finally, we needed to update our pricing page to explain the new differences between Refuel (our pay-as-you-go option) and Pulse. Our idea was to design a page for each &ndash; giving us the opportunity to go into detail on benefits, use cases, and customer feedback specific to both plans.</p>

            <div class="mt-3 mb-3 mt-md-4 mb-md-4">
                <div class="b-1">

                </div>
                <p class="text-smaller">Our first attempt at a set of pricing pages for Refuel and Pulse</p>
            </div>

            <p>Splitting pricing across two pages was confusing in practice. Emotional use cases can be effective, but we relied too heavily on them at the expense of making our plans understandable. People wanted to see features laid out side-by-side &ndash; giving them the chance to make their own decision on which plan worked for them. We eventually consolidated the two pages to one.</p>

            <div class="mt-3 mb-3 mt-md-4 mb-md-4">
                <div class="b-1">

                <p class="text-smaller">The second version of our pricing page</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Karma's Future</h2>

            <p>I'm eager to see where Karma goes from here. Neverstop's failure was challenging, but the team is persistent and upcoming features will further differentiate the company from traditional&nbsp;Telecoms.</p>

            <p>Like my work at <a href="/etsy">Etsy</a> and <a href="/cover/">Cover</a>, I'm happy to say we created something for the right reasons &ndash; working towards a future of affordable and accessible Internet for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
